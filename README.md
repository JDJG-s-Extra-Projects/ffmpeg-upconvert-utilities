# ffmpeg-upconvert-ulities
Has programs that upconvert stuff with ffmpeg

You'll want a version of ffmpeg with cuda compiled with it like:

https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds

I use the full ffmpeg-release-full.7z of the lastest version but it seems

ffmpeg-release-full-shared.7z may also work on paper.



(trust ffmpeg takes a while to compile)

For Linux instructions the only method I know how is to build it yourself which you can do with

Will find a pre-built binary eventually.
