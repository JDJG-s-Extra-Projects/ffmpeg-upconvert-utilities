Notes

# Concat Videos

- Needs to respect video order

- Create screenshot variation (with 5 seconds in between maybe input could handle it)

# shorts marker (batch file)

- does not make a proper format that youtube accepts for it to still be a short

# Test shorts (batch file)

- Final output is way smaller than it ought to be.

# upconvert test (bash file)

- No way to handle ffmpeg install and system build up (why isn't there a built ffmpeg with everything we need on linux)?

# upconvert (bash file)

- similar issue to upconvert test

# upload

- Unable to figure out how the YouTube Stuff api works
