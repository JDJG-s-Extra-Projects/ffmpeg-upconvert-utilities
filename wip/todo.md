# Concat Screenshots

- Needs to respect screenshot order

# shorts marker (batch file)

- does not make a proper format that youtube accepts for it to still be a short

- No way to handle ffmpeg install and system build up (why isn't there a built ffmpeg with everything we need on linux)?

# upconvert (bash file)

- similar issue to upconvert test

# upload
